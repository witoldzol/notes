First day of freedom. I've finished my fourth degree, which is a complete overkill, but hey, what can you do? 
So what now? Prep for interview! Already got a fancy book, with hundreds of exercises to do. We'll see how this 
fares. Not sure if I want to do the exercises in Java or stick to JS. Probably latter, given that I really want 
to focus on just one programming language. I'm also changing the morning routine. I'll be waking up at 4am now,
as opposed to 5.30, because I found that I'm just not gettin anything done in the afternoon after work. So yea,
I'll give it a go and see what happens.
